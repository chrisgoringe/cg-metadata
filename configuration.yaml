# Nodes from which to get the metadata. The format is:
# key, node_title, output_or_input
# where key is the key under which this data is to be stored
# node_title is the title of the node in your workflow (use #n to get the n'th instance)
# output_or_input is the name of an output, or of an input (or widget) of a node (append '!' to skip outputs when there are both inputs and outputs)
#
#Turn debug on to list node names and the available outputs and inputs
